## 8. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use now.ink for my side project that might make money later?**  
A: Yes, while it's non-profit. Once you monetize, you'll need a commercial license.

**Q: Can I fork now.ink and start a competing service?**  
A: Yes, under GPL-3.0, but you must open-source your modifications. For a closed-source fork, you need a commercial license.

**Q: Do I need a license if I just mint NFTs on the public now.ink platform?**  
A: No! That's regular usage. Licenses apply to running your own instance or integrating the codebase.

**Q: What if I'm a non-profit organization?**  
A: Non-profits can use GPL-3.0 (personal use license) for free.

**Q: Can I contribute without signing away my rights?**  
A: Yes! You retain copyright. The CLA just grants us usage rights under both licenses.
