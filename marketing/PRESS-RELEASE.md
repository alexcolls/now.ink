## now.ink Launches: A Decentralized Platform Where Users Own Their Video Moments as NFTs

*Anti-algorithm, anti-AI social platform lets users record GPS-tagged videos and mint them as blockchain-owned NFTs*

**[CITY, STATE] – [Launch Date]** – now.ink, a revolutionary decentralized social media platform, today announced its official launch on iOS and Android. The platform enables users to record GPS-tagged video moments and mint them as NFTs on the Solana blockchain, permanently stored on Arweave—giving users true ownership of their content.

### The Problem: Social Media is Broken

Today's social media landscape is dominated by algorithms that manipulate user attention, AI-generated content that erodes authenticity, and platforms that monetize user data while retaining ownership of user-generated content. Users have become products rather than owners.

### The Solution: True Ownership Through Blockchain

now.ink takes a radically different approach:

- **GPS-Tagged Recording**: Every video captures the exact location where it was recorded, creating an authentic map of real human experiences.
- **NFT Ownership**: Videos are minted as NFTs on Solana blockchain and permanently stored on Arweave, giving users verifiable ownership.
- **No Algorithms**: Content is displayed chronologically—no engagement-based recommendations, no manipulation.
- **Anti-AI**: Only live-captured content is allowed—no uploads, no AI-generated videos.
- **Transparent & Open Source**: The entire platform is open source and built on public blockchain infrastructure.

### Key Features

**📍 GPS-Tagged Moments**  
Every video automatically captures GPS coordinates, creating a global map of authentic human experiences.

**🪙 Blockchain Ownership**  
Videos are minted as NFTs on Solana (~$0.50 per mint) and stored permanently on Arweave. Users truly own their content forever.

**🗺️ Interactive World Map**  
Explore moments from around the globe. Discover what's happening near you or anywhere in the world.

**📱 Mobile-First Experience**  
Clean, intuitive interface designed for iOS and Android. No clutter, no distractions.

**🔐 Privacy-First**  
GDPR compliant with full user control over content visibility and data handling.

### Philosophy: Anti-Algorithm, Anti-AI, Pro-Ownership

"Social media broke," said [Founder Name], creator of now.ink. "Algorithms hijacked our attention. AI poisoned authenticity. We built now.ink as the antidote. Users own their content. No algorithms decide what you see. No AI generates fake experiences. Just real moments, real places, real ownership."

The platform's core principles:
- ✅ Real > Fake
- ✅ Ownership > Renting  
- ✅ Chronological > Algorithmic
- ✅ Decentralized > Centralized
- ✅ Transparent > Black Box
